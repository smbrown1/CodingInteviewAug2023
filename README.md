# Coding Interview Aug 2023
This project uses the following assumptions
- If you rent a tool for one day you return it the same day you got it. So if you check it out on 7/3/2020
    for 3 days you would use it on the third, fourth, and fifth, then return it on the 7/5/2020.
    
Potential Future Work
- Optimization around tool rental longer than a year
